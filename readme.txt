My program does compile and work on the dijkstra server properly. 

However, if you face a "segmentation fault" originated because of stdstring (I don't know why)
you can try to run each method separately but I believe that I have solved this problem. 

If an unexpected error occurs on dijkstra, I guarantee that it will work on your favorite IDE :).
